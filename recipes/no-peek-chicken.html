			Sometimes I’m in the mood to whip up a homemade feast, and sometimes I’m
			in the mood to dump some things in a dish, bake it, and call it a day.
			When you’re in the latter mood (it happens a lot, doesn’t it?), no-peek
			chicken is the solution.
		</p>
		<p class="description">
			With the help of some clever pantry items, you can have creamy, flavorful
			chicken and rice with almost no effort. While the one-dish meal bakes,
			you’re free to do some laundry, help the kids with homework, or just lay
			back with a glass of wine.

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="list-item">Cooking spray</li>
			<li class="list-item">1 (10.5-ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
			<li class="list-item">1 (10.5-ounce) can cream of celery soup</li>
			<li class="list-item">1 1/2 cups water</li>
			<li class="list-item">2 cups quick-cooking rice (such as Minute Rice)</li>
			<li class="list-item">1 cup frozen peas and carrots mix</li>
			<li class="list-item">
				1 (2-ounce) package onion soup mix (such as Lipton), divided
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">
				4 (7-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
			<li class="list-item">1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li class="list-item">2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, optional</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
		<ol class="list">
			<li class="list-item">
				<strong> Preheat oven to 350˚F. </strong> <br />
				Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish
				with cooking spray.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">
				<strong> Make the sauce: </strong> <br />
				Add the cream of chicken soup, cream of celery soup, and water to the
				baking dish and whisk together until combined. Stir in the rice,
				vegetable medley, and half of the onion soup mix (4 tablespoons) until
				combined.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">
				<strong> Add the chicken: </strong> <br />
				Sprinkle the chicken breasts evenly with salt and pepper. Nestle the
				chicken into the rice mixture. Sprinkle the remaining onion soup mix
				evenly over the chicken. Cover with aluminum foil.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">
				<strong> Bake: </strong> <br />
				Bake until the chicken is cooked through, or an instant-read thermometer
				registers 160°F when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken (the
				temperature of the chicken will continue to rise to 165°F as it rests),
				and the rice is tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let
				rest for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork. Top with
				chives (if using) and serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container in
				the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
			</li>
